## Education

I studied at the NIIT on the course "Integrated software development". Programming languages ​​such as C, Java and JS were studied in this program. The course was built not only on a theoretical basis, there were also practical lessons. Most of them can be found on my github profile. There was also a course for raising the level of English to intermediate.
